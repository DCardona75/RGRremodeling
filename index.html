                            <p><b>What makes us different?</b></p>                        
                            <p>We make sure our job sites are always clean and work alongside our crews. We care about the reputation of our company, which we always have great communication with our clients and provide great service. 
                                Robert, as the contractor has worked in the field before owning a business, this has allowed him to understand the entire process of any project. We work with 3D renderings so our clients can have a visual of what the outcome will be, making them more comfortable with the process. 
                                Not only have we worked with clients, but our company has experience with investors and realtors as well. Our company can take on any type of remodeling project without the client having to hire multiple sub-contractors to get the job done.  </p>

They worked their tails off and were friendly to my family. Robert and Jose made sure that there was no detail that was overlooked and were patient in answering the million questions we had and went with the flow when we changed our minds on colors, cabinets or needed more time to decide on tile selections. I could not recommend this company any more strongly. They really made the whole project as comfortable as possible."</p>

They were friendly, not looking for ways to overcharge us, and I was happy to support their business. Lastly, I felt safe leaving my client with them. My client was also very happy; they even helped her get a dresser to the garage to prep for showings. Not 'nickel and diming' her. Just seems to be good old guys. And this reflects well on me as a Real Estate Professional. Hope to see you again, RGR. Best"</p>
